# check - path checking helper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nirs/check.svg?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/nirs/check)

This program is providing path checking services for vdsm.

The program is running as a child process, accepting commands on stdin,
sending events on stdout, and logging messages on stderr.

## Commands

- `start PATH INTERVAL`

  Start checking PATH every INTERVAL seconds. A "start" event will be
  sent as response.

- `stop PATH`

  Stop checking PATH. A "stop" event will be sent as a response.

## Events

- `start PATH ERRNO DESCRIPTION`

  A "start" command completed. On success (`ERRNO=0`), a "check" event
  will be sent when the first check completes.

- `check PATH ERRNO [DELAY|DESCRIPTION]`

  A check for PATH completed. On success (`ERRNO=0`), DELAY is the read
  delay in seconds.

- `stop PATH ERRNO DESCRIPTION`

  A "stop" command completed. On success (`ERRNO=0`), no more "check"
  events will be sent. If path checker is busy and cannot be stopped
  immediately , an EINPROGRESS error is returned, and a second event
  will be sent when io has completed and the path checker has stopped.

## Logging

- `LEVEL message...` - log message at LEVEL

The parent process may log the messages using its own logger.

## Example session

```
